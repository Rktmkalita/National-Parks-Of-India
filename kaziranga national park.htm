<font size=4 color=green>In the state of Assam, in India's north east region, on the banks of the 
Brahmaputra River. 217 kilometers from Guwahati, 96 kilometers from Jorhat, and 75 kilometers from 
Furkating. The main entrance to the park is located at Kohora on National Highway 37, where there's 
a Tourist Complex and booking offices. Buses stop there on the way from Guwahati, Tezpur and Upper 
Assam. The park has four ranges -- Central (Kazaringa), Western (Baguri), Eastern (Agoratuli), and 
Burhapahar. The most accessible and popular range is the Central one, at Kohora. The Western range, 
25 minutes from Kohora, is the shortest circuit but has the highest density of rhinos. It's 
recommended for seeing rhinos and buffaloes. The Eastern range is around 40 minutes from Kohora 
and offers the longest circuit. Birding is the highlight there.

There are airports at Guwahati (which has flights from all over India) and Jorhat (best accessed from Kolkata). Then, 
it's a six hour drive from Guwahati and two hour drive from Jorhat, in private taxi or public bus. From Guwahati, 
expect to pay around 300 rupees by public transport and 2,500 rupees by private transport. Some hotels will provide 
pick up services. The nearest railway stations are at Jakhalabandha, one hour away (trains run there from Guwahati, 
take the Guwahati-Silghat Town Passenger/55607), and Furkating (trains from Delhiand Kolkata). Buses stop at the park 
entrance on the way from Guwahati, Tezpur and Upper Assam.</font></td></tr></table><br><table bgcolor=lightyellow><tr><td>
<u><b><font size=5 color=navy>When to Visit Kaziranga: </font></u></b><font size=4 color=green>
Kazaringa is open daily from November 1 to April 30 every year. According to locals, the best time to visit is during late 
February and March, when the December and January peak season rush is over. The park gets extremely busy during the peak season, 
and it's likely to negatively affect your experience there due to the large amount of people allowed in. Be prepared for hot 
weather from March to May, and cold weather from November to January. A week long Kaziranga Elephant Festival takes place 
at the park in February.</td><td align=right><img src=images472.jpg height=150px width=175px alt="sorry for inconvenience"></td>

<td align=justify><u><b><font size=5 color=navy>Kaziranga Travel Tips: </font></u></b><font size=4 color=green>
Jeep and elephant safaris are possible in all ranges except Burhapahar, which offers jeep safaris only. Boat rides are offered at 
the north eastern point of the park. If you're planning on going on an elephant safari, it's best to do it in the Central range, as 
it's government operated there. Book it the prior evening, from 6 p.m. at the Tourist Complex office near the range. Private 
elephant safari providers in the other ranges have been known to cut short the duration of the safaris during peak times, so 
that they can serve more people and make more money. It's possible to see the rhinos up close on the elephant safaris. Try to avoid 
the first safaris of the morning in winter though, as fog and late sunrise hamper viewing. You can take your own private vehicle 
into the park if accompanied by a forest official.</font></td></tr></table><br><table bgcolor=lightyellow><tr>
<td align=justify><u><b><font size=5 color=navy>Kaziranga Hotels: </font></u></b><font size=4 color=green>
One of the most popular Kazirange hotels is the new and sprawling IORA - The Retreatresort, located on 20 acres of land just a couple 
of kilometers from the park's main entrance. Best of all, it's reasonably priced for what's provided. Diphlu River Lodgeis another 
new hotel, located around 15 minutes west of the tourist complex. It's a unique place to stay, with 12 cottages on stilts overlooking 
the river. Unfortunately, the tariff for foreigners is double that for Indians, and it is costly. Wild Grass Lodgeis a reputable 
option that's popular with foreign visitors, located in Bossagaon village, a short drive from Kohora. To be as close as possible to 
nature, try the Nature-Hunt Eco Camp.If you're on a tight budget, you can't pass up the cute Unicorn Cottages. Call: +91 94351 97601.

Central range office. It was once managed by Assam Tourism, but is now leased out to a private operator, Network Travels in Guwahati.
