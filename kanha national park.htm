<td align=justify><font size=4 color=blue>Kanha National Park has the honor of providing the setting 
for Rudyard Kipling’s classic novel, The Jungle Book. It’s rich in lush saal and bamboo forests, lakes, 
streams and open grasslands. The park is one of the largest national parks in India, with a core area 
of 940 square kilometers (584 square miles) and surrounding area of 1,005 square kilometers (625 square miles). 
Kanha is well regarded for its research and conservation programs, and many endangered species have been saved 
there. As well as tigers, the park abounds with barasingha (swamp deer) and an extensive variety of other animals 
and birds. Rather than offering one particular kind of animal, it provides an all-round nature experience.

<tr><td><u><b><font size=5 color=green>Kanha Location:</font></b></u><font size=4 color=blue> In the state of Madhya Pradesh, 
160 kilometers (100 miles) south east of Jabalpur. 
The park has three entrances. The main one is the Khatia Gate, which leads into the park's buffer zone. A few 
kilometers ahead of it lies the Kisli Gate, which leads into the park's premium Kanha core zone. The other two gates 
are Mukki, and Sarhi (a relatively new gate). Kisli-Khatia and Mukki are located at opposite ends of the park. It's 
possible to drive between them although it takes around 4 hours. The Kanha zone is most popular as tiger sightings 
are more frequent at that end of the park.

Air Deccan flies directly to Jabalpur from Delhi, then it’s around 4-5 hours by road from there to the park. Alternatively, 
Jabalpur can also be reached by rail.</font><br><br>
<u><b><font size=5 color=green>When to Visit Kahna: </font></b></u><font size=4 color=blue>
March and April, when it starts getting hot and the animals come out in search of water. Try to avoid the peak months from 
December to January, and March during the Indian Holi festival, as it’s very busy. It can also get extremely cold during 
the winter, particularly in January.
