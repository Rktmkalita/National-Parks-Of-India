National parks in India are IUCN category II protected areas. India's first national 
park was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, now known as Jim Corbett National 
Park. By 1970, India only had five national parks. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife 
Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard the habitats of conservation reliant species. 
Further federal legislation strengthening protections for wildlife was introduced in 
the 1980s. As of April 2012, there were 102 national parks. All national park lands 
then encompassed a total 39,919 km2 (15,413 sq mi) km², comprising 1.21% of India's 
total surface area. A total of 166 national parks have been authorized. Plans are underway to establish the remaining scheduled parks. All of India's national parks are listed below alongside their home state or territory, area and the date that they were established. See Protected areas of India for an overview of all Indian protected areas.
