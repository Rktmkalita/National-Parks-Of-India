of history and nature. Inside the park is a formidable fort that was built in the 10th century and 
coveted by many rulers due to its strategic position between north and central India. 
The park itself is situated at the joining of the Vindhya Plateau and the Aravalli Hills, and is 
characterized by rocky plains and steep cliffs. It supports a diverse range of flora and fauna,

<td align=justify><u><b><font size=5 color=green>Ranthambore Travel Tips: </font></u></b>
<font size=4 color=red>This national park is very popular due to its proximity to Delhi and the fact that 
tigers are relatively easy to spot here. Traffic into the park is highly regulated. Private vehicles are not 
allowed to enter, and the number of jeeps is restricted to 20 at one time, split along 5 different zones. 
Availability of seats tends to vary quite a bit, therefore seats are best booked as far in advance as possible. 
Some zones, particularly two and three, are better than others for seeing tigers. Zone one is highly avoidable. 
However it’s not possible to choose your route. Selection is carried out by a lottery conducted by forest 
officials. This has given rise to claims of briberyto get a preferred route.
